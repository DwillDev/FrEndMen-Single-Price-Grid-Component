## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project as a chance to learn about deploying selectors and using html semantics properly. I feel I did both effectively, and I am also proud that this time it only took me about  7 hours over the course of one day to finish and make this site more responsive than my previous ones, which took far more time and more code to make the same thing happen.

### Continued development

I hope to continue to take less time building responsive pages and becoming more comfortable with Flexbox and Grid as time goes on and I complete more challenges. I am not comfortable with all of the different CSS properties yet and tend to stick to the ones I am familiar with, so I would like to leave my comfort zone and start learning about other properties.

### Useful resources

- [Guide on using sections and outlines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/Using_HTML_sections_and_outlines) - This assisted me greatly in deciphering which semantic tags were appropriate for this project and I will be referencing it for projects from now on.
- [Angela Delise's Responsive Grid Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68O6eOGAGqA) - I watched this fatastic crash course on Grid a few weeks ago and recalled what she did when converting the mobile layout into a desktop one.
